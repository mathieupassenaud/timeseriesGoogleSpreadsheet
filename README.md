# Google Apps Script - timeseries on google Spreadsheet

https://script.google.com

Create a spreadsheet, get your sheet id and paste it into the field "spreadsheetid".

Deploy this script as a web application, retrieve generated URI and paste it in the index.html file.

Load the index.html page with firefox on android (or iOS ??? not tested right now), create an ID and start pushing values.

Enjoy :)
